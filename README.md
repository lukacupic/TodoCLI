TODO Finder CLI, version `0.0.7`.

This is a small Java CLI tool which scans the directory where it's being run and reports all the TODOs or FIXMEs found in the code files.

## Contributing 

If you would like to contribute, just open an issue or a PR.

You will need Java 11.
Make sure the maven build:

``$mvn clean install -Pcheckstyle,itcases``

passes before making a PR. [Checkstyle](http://checkstyle.sourceforge.net/) will make sure
you're following our code style and guidelines.

It's better to make changes on a separate branch (derived from ``master``), so you won't have to cherry pick commits in case your PR is rejected.
